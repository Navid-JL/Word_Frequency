# Project

Word Frequency app counts the frequency of words in a block of text and creates a tabular display of each unique word in the text along with its frequency, in descending order by frequency.

### Todo

- [ ] Implement a function that shows some information about the app and asks the user to enter a valid input  
- [ ] Implement a function that reads user input from the console and stores it in a variable called user_input  
- [ ] Implement an error handling system that throws appropriate exceptions when the user enters wrong input or when the input entered by the user is invalid or does not match the expected format or data type.  
- [ ] Implement changes to the color scheme and font size to improve readability  
- [ ] Implement a function that nicely outputs the results to the console  
- [ ] Implement a feature to save the word frequency table to a text/csv file.  
- [ ] Test the application to ensure that all requirements are met.
